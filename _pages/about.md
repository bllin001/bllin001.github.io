## About me üòÄ
My name is Brian Llin√°s, and I joined the Web Science and Digital Libraries (WS-DL) research group at Old Dominion University (ODU) as a Ph.D. student in the Spring of 2023, supervised by Dr. Michael Nelson. I recently earned my bachelor‚Äôs degree in Industrial Engineering from Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia.

I have two years of research experience, collaborating with professors from UniNorte on topics such as Operation Research, Humanitarian Logistics, Simulation & Transportation, and Machine Learning. I developed a particular affinity for Machine Learning, Data Science, and statistical analysis. 

As part of the SIMAS-UN research group and Storymodelers Lab at VMASC, I contributed to projects exploring frustration in migrant communities. This work inspired my decision to pursue a Ph.D. to further enhance my knowledge of data science and modeling.

I have work experience as a **Data Scientist** at Fintra S.A. (financial sector) and DataLeik (consulting sector), where I handled large volumes of customer data, cleaned and visualized datasets, and implemented predictive models for decision-making.

I'm also passionate about teaching, having served as an undergraduate teaching assistant at UniNorte for courses like **Engineering Data Analysis I**, **Engineering Data Analysis II**, and **Integral Quality Management and Control**.
